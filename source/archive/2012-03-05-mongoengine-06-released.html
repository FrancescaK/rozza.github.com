<p>Sorry for the delay, a few final things snuck into 0.6 to get the release in really good shape.</p>
<p>Another massive <a href="http://docs.mongoengine.org/en/latest/changelog.html?highlight=changelog#changes-in-0-6">changelog</a> but the big items are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharding support</strong><br />through the <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/mongoengine-odm/en/latest/guide/defining-documents.html#shard-keys">shard_key</a> meta data.</li>
<li><strong>ReplicaSet Support</strong><br />You can now connect to replica sets for slave okay reads.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Documents</strong><br />A new base class for documents that allows fully dynamic documents (or embedded documents) with expando style attribute setting.</li>
<li><strong>PyMongo 2.2 support</strong><br />PyMongo imports now cleaned up for PyMongo 2.2 support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other improvements worth a mention are: ImageField, scalar values, $elementMatch support, URI connection support and many more small bugfixes and improvements.</p>
