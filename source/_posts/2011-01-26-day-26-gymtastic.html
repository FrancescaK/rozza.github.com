<p>Well it was up and at em today! &nbsp;I was in the gym for 6:30 so I could get my janathon fix in for the day. &nbsp;I still feel self conscious at the gym - hoping that will wear off as I get used to the equipment and the gym.</p>
<p>Focusing on upper body / core strength I found it a little easier this time than last!</p>
<p><strong>Stats</strong>:<br /><strong>Weights</strong>: 35 mins<br /><strong>Cardo</strong>: 5 mins (rowing to cool down)<br /><strong>Stretches</strong>: 5 (very self conscious) mins (I haven't noticed anyone else doing stretches..)</p>
