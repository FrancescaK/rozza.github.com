<p>I've been doing a lot of <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> configuration tweaking recently, due to some complex requirements for a virtual host I'm writing for a relaunch due later this month.  As I came across a couple of gotchas and problems that required a lot of head scratching, googling and trawling through the <a href="http://forum.nginx.org/">forums</a>, I thought I'd write a series of short posts to try and help any other folk that may have similar Nginx configuration problems in the future.</p>
<h2>Multiple if statements</h2>
<p>As Nginx doesn't allow multiple or nested if statements you can't do something like:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>if ($request_method = POST &amp;&amp; $http_cookie ~* &quot;CCCC=.+(?:;|$)&quot;)</pre></div>
</div>

<p>However, you can set variables and you can do if statements on variables so this can be rewritten:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>if ($request_method = POST) {
    set $test  P;
  }

  if ($http_cookie ~* &quot;CCCC=.+(?:;|$)&quot; ) {
    set $test  &quot;${test}C&quot;;
  }

  if ($test = PC) {
    #rewrite rule goes here.
  }</pre></div>
</div>

<p>As you can use regular expressions on if statements this method allows you to do both &amp;&amp; and | checks.</p>
<p>The example is taken from a hidden away example on the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxRewriteMultiCondExample">wiki</a> but as it took me ages to find hopefully it will help you to.</p>
