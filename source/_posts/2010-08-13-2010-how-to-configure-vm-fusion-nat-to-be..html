<p>I do <em>all</em> my development on VMWares, as they are cheap and easy to setup and mimic the real deployment environment.  I've always used NAT networking on my vmwares rather than put them on the network as standalone bridged items, however, recently I was asked to "share" my latest code on the network.  My host hacks didn't get translated so I needed to to forward the port 80 traffic from the Mac to the VM</p>
<p>Turns out its easy - <a href="http://www.virtuatopia.com/index.php/VMware_Server_NAT_Configuration#.5Bincomingtcp.5D">nat.conf</a> is the key. Just add the configuration to</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>/Library/Application\ Support/VMware\ Fusion/vmnet8/nat.conf</pre></div>
</div>

<p>in the incomingtcp configuration.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[incomingtcp]
80 = IP_OF_THE_VMWARE:80</pre></div>
</div>

<p>And restart the vmware networking:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>sudo /Library/Application\ Support/VMware\ Fusion/boot.sh --restart</pre></div>
</div>
