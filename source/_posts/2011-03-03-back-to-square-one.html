<p>After a week of illness, that started with the kids and a&nbsp;norovirus style illness, I felt really fatigued and eventually got a cold, &nbsp;so I took a weeks rest and off training, no fun but recovery is important. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've decided to start the training back at week 1 and first off on Sunday, I did the BHF's Knebworth house jog, a slightly disorganised and short 10k but a good hilly cross country run!</p>
