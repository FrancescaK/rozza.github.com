<p>Well today I went to the gym for 45 minutes. &nbsp;The plan for the gym is to focus on upper body and core strength, I figure the running is good for the legs and cycling will be to! &nbsp;So after beasting myself on the weights (doing relatively small weights on the various torture machines) my arms, chest and back are now tender (read f'ing hurt). &nbsp;So much so&nbsp;I'm really glad I have power steering, as I could really feel it straight after on the drive home! &nbsp;I'm hoping this is a newbie thing and that I will soon get used to doing weights and be able to lift weights that someone my size should be able to!</p>
