<p>Hurray!&nbsp;<a href="http://mongoengine.org">MongoEngine</a> 0.5 has finally been released!</p>
<p>With many improvements and bug fixes means that MongoEngine is more powerful than ever!</p>
<p>Core improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient save<br /></strong>Now when you save an existing object it atomically updates only what has been changed. Making it super efficient and so easy to use, without having to worrying about race conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Database Referencing<br /></strong>MongoEngine saves you queries by intelligently identifiying and dereferencing DBReference fields.</li>
<li><strong>Complex fields<br /></strong>Dictionary and List fields can store any complex data you require; other dictionaries, lists and other documents.</li>
<li><strong>Signal support<br /></strong>pre and post save / delete.</li>
<li><strong>Subfield slicing<br /></strong>For retrieving parts of subsets of lists, keeping data transfer down.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract Base Classes<br /></strong>Helps keep your document definitions dry so you can easily extend Documents.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Object Managers<br /></strong>When used with Astract Base Classes you can easily apply behaviour across all querysets.</li>
<li><strong>query_counter<br /></strong>A context manager, that helps you determine the cost of some queries / code - great for testing!</li>
</ul>
