<p>Finally, I can use the gym, I'm paying for! &nbsp;After signing up and paying on MondayI was told I had to do an induction before being allowed to use the gym. &nbsp;Well, I went last night and after being wieghed, measured; height, blood pressure and pulse: 14st 10lb, 193cm, 83/130, 48 bpm. &nbsp;I told them I had used the gym before and after being tested I could use a machine, they said I was free to use the gym! So I spent 30 mins doing some weights and finished off with a 5 minute row.</p>
<p>If anyone has any good advice on resources for planning a core strength workout - let me know! &nbsp;Its my main area of focus for the gym in prep for my first Olympic triathlon in July!</p>
<p>The commute was good, did my fastest time to kings cross in the evening! &nbsp;However, I did see on cyclist take out a young lady who stepped out into the cycling lane at a traffic lights without looking - note to self cycle defensively!</p>
