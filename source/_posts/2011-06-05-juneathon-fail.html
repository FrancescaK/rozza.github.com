<p>Well after having a great camping trip at the start of a week holiday, the Lawleys decided to head off camping again. &nbsp;So I failed to start off Juneathon :( &nbsp;I have had a great and active June so far, country walks, loads off fresh air and my triathlon training is 6 days a week, so I wont be missing out, but alas I wont be blogging it all.</p>
<p>Good luck to the other Juneathletes!</p>
