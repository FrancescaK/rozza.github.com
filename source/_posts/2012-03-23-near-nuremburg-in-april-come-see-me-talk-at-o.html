<p>I've just got back from a buzzing mongoDB Berlin - it was a great event with lots of developers wanting to learn more about <a href="http://mongodb.org" title="MongoDB" target="_blank">mongoDB</a>. What struck me most was the level of interest in Germany for mongoDB and the general enthusiasm around web and computing technology; from big data to agile methodology and devops to high scalability.</p>
<p>With that in mind I'm really pleased to announce I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.netways.de/en/osdc/osdc_2012" title="OSDC.de conference: data, ops, scaling">Open Source Data Center</a> conference in Nuremberg next month. &nbsp;I'm really looking forward to the conference as it covers all things&nbsp;DevOps, Databases and Scalability.</p>
<p>So if you are in the neighbourhood then make sure you come by, I'm there for two days and will be happy to answer any questions regarding mongoDB.</p>
