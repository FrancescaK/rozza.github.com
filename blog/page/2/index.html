  <p>For the last few months at work <a href="http://streetlife.com" target="_blank">we&#8217;ve</a> been adopting MongoDB as our main database. For those that don&#8217;t know what MongoDB is and you&#8217;re still reading this?!  &#8221;<em>MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented database designed with both scalability and developer agility in mind. Instead of storing your data in tables and rows as you would with a relational database, in MongoDB you store JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming from a Django background, <a href="http://mongoengine.org/" target="_blank">MongoEngine</a> &#8221;<em>a Document-Object Mapper (think ORM, but for document databases) for working with MongoDB from Python</em>&#8221; seemed a natural choice.  Since joining the project, as well as fixing numerous bugs, we&#8217;ve added many new features to MongoEngine core.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added complex Dictionary / List fields - Which&nbsp;can store any complex data you require; other dictionaries, lists, references.</li>
<li>Signal support -&nbsp;pre and post save / delete.</li>
<li>Subfield slicing - for retrieving parts of subsets of lists.</li>
<li>Abstract Base Classes - Helps keep your document definitions dry</li>
<li>Custom Object Managers - When used with Astract Base Classes you can easily apply behaviour across all querysets.</li>
<li>Delta tracking - Now save on an existing object, atomically updates only what has been changed.  Making it super efficient and so easy to use, without having to worrying about race conditions.</li>
<li>Select Related support - Now generic / reference fields can use select_related to minimise the number of queries to mongo.</li>
<li>query_counter - A context manager, that helps you determine the cost of some queries / code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the above, I&#8217;ll blog about in more depth in the near future as especially the delta tracking is pretty cool. &nbsp;In the near future the 0.5 release will be out - its on the dev branch if you want to play with it now. &nbsp;With more ideas / suggestions for improvements being added to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hmarr/mongoengine/issues" target="_blank">github</a>, it seems that MongoEngine will only get better.  So why not signup to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mongoengine-users" target="_blank">usergroup</a> and join in the discussion.</p>

  <p>Well after having a great camping trip at the start of a week holiday, the Lawleys decided to head off camping again. &nbsp;So I failed to start off Juneathon :( &nbsp;I have had a great and active June so far, country walks, loads off fresh air and my triathlon training is 6 days a week, so I wont be missing out, but alas I wont be blogging it all.</p>
<p>Good luck to the other Juneathletes!</p>

<p>Roll up, roll up! &nbsp;Juneathon is nearly on us sign up here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.juneathon.com/">http://www.juneathon.com/</a></p>
<p>What is it? &nbsp;Its a festival of exercise for the month of june!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">It&#8217;s primarily a running challenge, but if you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to run every day, you can still join in by cycling, walking, rowing, weights, swimming, building sandcastles or whatever. Just do&nbsp;<em><strong>something</strong></em>&nbsp;every day in June</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds difficult? &nbsp;It really isn&#8217;t, just remember you don&#8217;t have to over do it, just do a little bit of something every day. &nbsp; I found janathon hugely rewarding and it really got me into the zone of doing more exercise in prep for my triathlons. &nbsp;I covered 98.1 miles in a month, running over 50 of them, now I have a bike I&#8217;ll smash those stats, but I still doubt I&#8217;ll catch the winner of who ran an immense 450 miles in January!</p>

  <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.galeforce-events.com/sprintseries.htm" title="Galeforce sprint series" target="_blank">Galeforce events</a> for putting on a great event, it was my first real sprint triathlon - I did one back in 2003 but with no training I don&#8217;t really count it.</p>
<p>The venue was easy to get to and had ample parking, I was slightly nervous using my new bike rack on the car, but it was great (thanks Halfords!). &nbsp;I got there with plenty of time to spare, got my transition area sorted. &nbsp;I noticed lots of people using plastic boxes to carry / store their transition kit in - much easier and tidier than a bag, so I&#8217;ll do the same next time. &nbsp;The swimming pool changing rooms were open, but don&#8217;t really have many facilities - there was always a queue for the gents (pre race jitters I suppose). &nbsp;I put myself down for a 5:30 swim based on my training the week before, so I had a long wait before starting - over an hour. &nbsp;A feel laps of the diving pool, did little to calm the nerves.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Swim - 400m (07:00)</span></p>
<p>I was expecting better from myself in terms of time, but it didn&#8217;t click, my breathing was laboured and it felt far more tiring than I expected and I was over taken twice, so not great in the end it took me 7 mins to complete. &nbsp;Not great at all, so next sprint I&#8217;ll use that time and should get in and started sooner.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bike - 24k (56:14)</span></p>
<p>The transition went ok, I decided against putting socks on, so just dried myself quickly, hat on and off. &nbsp;The swim shorts felt really tight on my legs to begin with and I was worried that the rear tire was low / going flat. &nbsp;I worried too much, clipped the curb and flew off into the grass / nettles / thistles in the verge - ouch. &nbsp;I was all in one piece - grazed and had a burning sensation of the nettles but I got back on and got on with the ride. &nbsp;The ride itself seemed uphill to the A6 then dips and then a short sharp uphill before a downhill into Paversham. &nbsp;Then a nice downhill and fast on-in.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Run - 5k (25:51)</span></p>
<p>To me it felt a little shorter than 5k, but I did better than I thought I would and after 26mins I&#8217;d finished and felt like a triathlete!</p>
<p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Total Time: 1:31:12</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">[[posterous-content:BnlvJEcdBlpFhteydDHF]]</span></p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Post Tri</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bike incident hurt more than I realised, my shoulder took the brunt of the fall and ached, but worst of all was the itching from the nettles - took me ages to fall asleep. &nbsp;Note to self, look where your going when riding the bike!!</p>

  <p>After a week of illness, that started with the kids and a&nbsp;norovirus style illness, I felt really fatigued and eventually got a cold, &nbsp;so I took a weeks rest and off training, no fun but recovery is important. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to start the training back at week 1 and first off on Sunday, I did the BHF&#8217;s Knebworth house jog, a slightly disorganised and short 10k but a good hilly cross country run!</p>

  <p>Wow February is marching on and I feel like I&#8217;ve rested up for a couple of weeks after Janathon! &nbsp;But in truth I have been to the pool and to the Gym a couple of times, I&#8217;ve cycled on boris bikes and on static (*yawn*) bikes. &nbsp;But somehow not having the obligation to do something daily has made it feel like I&#8217;ve been resting! &nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have been focusing on recently is planning my training for the London Triathlon in just over 20 weeks.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:jBwduxGyCwewhnrDhdpD]]</p>
<p>The full schedule can be seen / downloaded here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B7YRMZQuGNQxYmFjM2YwNzEtMGVhNS00MWQxLWEyZjQtMGRjOWMxZWFiOTkw&amp;hl=en" title="Tri Plan" target="_blank">Tri Plan.pdf</a>&nbsp;- based on one seen on <a href="http://www.trifuel.com/triathlon-training/Olympic-Triathlon-Training.php" title="beginner triathlon plan" target="_blank">TriFuel</a>&nbsp;but tweaked to include gym strenghting as well (more on that in a future post).</p>
<p>Today, to start my focused gym sessions I went to the gym to calculate my One Repetition Maximums. &nbsp;This is slightly embarrising as you have to calculate the absolute maximum you can lift for any given exercise. &nbsp;As that could be dangerous the safe way to calculate it involves stacking the weights on and when you can <strong>only</strong> do between 3 - 10 reps you have a weight that you can used to calculate your 1 Rep Max.</p>
<p>I must have looked a sight, throwing weights on, huffing and puffing and only doing a few sets before wondering off to the next bit of kit. Anyway for prosperity here are my 1 Rep Maximums rounded down to the nearest actual weights for my current gym routine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squat: 45KG</li>
<li>Vertical Traction: 80KG</li>
<li>Leg Press: 95KG</li>
<li>Hammer Curl: 15KG</li>
<li>Leg Curl: 65KG</li>
<li>Push Down: 27.5KG</li>
<li>Cable Lateral Lift: 8KG</li>
</ul>
<p>The squat figure looks a little low given the leg press value, but I can always recalculate it. &nbsp;One thing I noticed is my legs (knees?) are relatively weak, so hopefully strength training will really benefit them for future runs / cycles.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
