    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well after having a great camping trip at the start of a week holiday, the Lawleys decided to head off camping again. &nbsp;So I failed to start off Juneathon :( &nbsp;I have had a great and active June so far, country walks, loads off fresh air and my triathlon training is 6 days a week, so I wont be missing out, but alas I wont be blogging it all.</p>


<p>Good luck to the other Juneathletes!</p>

<p>Roll up, roll up! &nbsp;Juneathon is nearly on us sign up here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.juneathon.com/">http://www.juneathon.com/</a></p>


<p>What is it? &nbsp;Its a festival of exercise for the month of june!</p>


<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">It's primarily a running challenge, but if you can't or don't want to run every day, you can still join in by cycling, walking, rowing, weights, swimming, building sandcastles or whatever. Just do&nbsp;<em><strong>something</strong></em>&nbsp;every day in June</span></p>

<p>Sounds difficult? &nbsp;It really isn't, just remember you don't have to over do it, just do a little bit of something every day. &nbsp; I found janathon hugely rewarding and it really got me into the zone of doing more exercise in prep for my triathlons. &nbsp;I covered 98.1 miles in a month, running over 50 of them, now I have a bike I'll smash those stats, but I still doubt I'll catch the winner of who ran an immense 450 miles in January!</p>
