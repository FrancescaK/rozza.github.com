    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well after having a great camping trip at the start of a week holiday, the Lawleys decided to head off camping again. &nbsp;So I failed to start off Juneathon :( &nbsp;I have had a great and active June so far, country walks, loads off fresh air and my triathlon training is 6 days a week, so I wont be missing out, but alas I wont be blogging it all.</p>


<p>Good luck to the other Juneathletes!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.galeforce-events.com/sprintseries.htm" title="Galeforce sprint series" target="_blank">Galeforce events</a> for putting on a great event, it was my first real sprint triathlon - I did one back in 2003 but with no training I don't really count it.</p>


<p>The venue was easy to get to and had ample parking, I was slightly nervous using my new bike rack on the car, but it was great (thanks Halfords!). &nbsp;I got there with plenty of time to spare, got my transition area sorted. &nbsp;I noticed lots of people using plastic boxes to carry / store their transition kit in - much easier and tidier than a bag, so I'll do the same next time. &nbsp;The swimming pool changing rooms were open, but don't really have many facilities - there was always a queue for the gents (pre race jitters I suppose). &nbsp;I put myself down for a 5:30 swim based on my training the week before, so I had a long wait before starting - over an hour. &nbsp;A feel laps of the diving pool, did little to calm the nerves.</p>


<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Swim - 400m (07:00)</span></p>


<p>I was expecting better from myself in terms of time, but it didn't click, my breathing was laboured and it felt far more tiring than I expected and I was over taken twice, so not great in the end it took me 7 mins to complete. &nbsp;Not great at all, so next sprint I'll use that time and should get in and started sooner.</p>


<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bike - 24k (56:14)</span></p>


<p>The transition went ok, I decided against putting socks on, so just dried myself quickly, hat on and off. &nbsp;The swim shorts felt really tight on my legs to begin with and I was worried that the rear tire was low / going flat. &nbsp;I worried too much, clipped the curb and flew off into the grass / nettles / thistles in the verge - ouch. &nbsp;I was all in one piece - grazed and had a burning sensation of the nettles but I got back on and got on with the ride. &nbsp;The ride itself seemed uphill to the A6 then dips and then a short sharp uphill before a downhill into Paversham. &nbsp;Then a nice downhill and fast on-in.</p>


<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Run - 5k (25:51)</span></p>


<p>To me it felt a little shorter than 5k, but I did better than I thought I would and after 26mins I'd finished and felt like a triathlete!</p>


<p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Total Time: 1:31:12</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">[[posterous-content:BnlvJEcdBlpFhteydDHF]]</span></p>
</p>


<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Post Tri</span></p>


<p>Unfortunately, the bike incident hurt more than I realised, my shoulder took the brunt of the fall and ached, but worst of all was the itching from the nettles - took me ages to fall asleep. &nbsp;Note to self, look where your going when riding the bike!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Up with the larks this morning to go for my weekly run with Adam. Still very dark in the mornings, so the first off road section was slightly hazardous. &nbsp;It seems to have got so much muddier in the last two weeks the fields have changed into a quagmire of mud and puddles. So not too dissimilar from last weekend!</p>


<p>The run felt great, in fact managed negative splits. &nbsp;By the end my legs were so tired I decided a cold bath would help them. &nbsp; Now for my momentous moment of the day: I managed a cold bath without screaming like a girl! &nbsp;As my legs were so muddy, I didn't stretch out after the run big mistake as after the cold bath my legs felt too cold to stretch out...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">The course was good, lots of puddles and lots you can avoid initially, but wheres the fun in that? &nbsp;The sooner your feet get wet the quicker you get used to it. &nbsp;At around 2 miles you couldn't really avoid the puddles - up to about thigh height at this point. &nbsp;Cold toes dont make for fun running, but you soon get them warmed up and then the later puddles feel refreshing! &nbsp;Some were strangley warm, probably best not to think about that...</p>


<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">The course was good and around 5 miles there was a real stinker of an obstacle; a cargo net and some excellent mud. &nbsp;Then into some water, I was in a rut and the water was up to my waist; being 6' 2" I can confirm it was deep!! &nbsp;Everyone slowed down to tackle that one, so once out I speeded up, but with tired legs and mud on my glasses I tripped and went flying. &nbsp;Everyone running by checked I was ok and one chap even gave me a score: 8.5 - Not Bad!</p>


<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">At 6 miles I thought only 2 and then in!! &nbsp;So I speeded up and OMG the last mile - b*stard. &nbsp;I liked the big dipper hill and finally nearing the end there was some more water, I stepped over a tree trunk and one leg disappeared to my thigh! &nbsp;Once I struggled out of that, my legs felt like blocks of lead, but it was the on-in. &nbsp;Into the big final puddle too fast I nearly went flying, out and round the corner and done!</p>


<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">A great event, tough on the legs but a hell of a lot of fun! &nbsp;I'll be back next year for sure.</p>
