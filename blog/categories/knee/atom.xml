    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow February is marching on and I feel like I've rested up for a couple of weeks after Janathon! &nbsp;But in truth I have been to the pool and to the Gym a couple of times, I've cycled on boris bikes and on static (*yawn*) bikes. &nbsp;But somehow not having the obligation to do something daily has made it feel like I've been resting! &nbsp;</p>


<p>What I have been focusing on recently is planning my training for the London Triathlon in just over 20 weeks.</p>


<p>[[posterous-content:jBwduxGyCwewhnrDhdpD]]</p>


<p>The full schedule can be seen / downloaded here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B7YRMZQuGNQxYmFjM2YwNzEtMGVhNS00MWQxLWEyZjQtMGRjOWMxZWFiOTkw&amp;hl=en" title="Tri Plan" target="_blank">Tri Plan.pdf</a>&nbsp;- based on one seen on <a href="http://www.trifuel.com/triathlon-training/Olympic-Triathlon-Training.php" title="beginner triathlon plan" target="_blank">TriFuel</a>&nbsp;but tweaked to include gym strenghting as well (more on that in a future post).</p>


<p>Today, to start my focused gym sessions I went to the gym to calculate my One Repetition Maximums. &nbsp;This is slightly embarrising as you have to calculate the absolute maximum you can lift for any given exercise. &nbsp;As that could be dangerous the safe way to calculate it involves stacking the weights on and when you can <strong>only</strong> do between 3 - 10 reps you have a weight that you can used to calculate your 1 Rep Max.</p>


<p>I must have looked a sight, throwing weights on, huffing and puffing and only doing a few sets before wondering off to the next bit of kit. Anyway for prosperity here are my 1 Rep Maximums rounded down to the nearest actual weights for my current gym routine:</p>


<ul>
<li>Squat: 45KG</li>
<li>Vertical Traction: 80KG</li>
<li>Leg Press: 95KG</li>
<li>Hammer Curl: 15KG</li>
<li>Leg Curl: 65KG</li>
<li>Push Down: 27.5KG</li>
<li>Cable Lateral Lift: 8KG</li>
</ul>


<p>The squat figure looks a little low given the leg press value, but I can always recalculate it. &nbsp;One thing I noticed is my legs (knees?) are relatively weak, so hopefully strength training will really benefit them for future runs / cycles.</p>
